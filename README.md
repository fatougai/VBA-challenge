In this project titled VBA-challenge, I have created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year, across multiple worksheets.
The script outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
         *This column is conditionally formatted to reflect negative or positive changes, in green and red, respectively.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  
  The script also has the functionality to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
